 *  TITLE:
 *      MainForm : Form
 *      
 *  DESCRIPTION:
 *      This class is the main form, it is the starting point of the application, and it is always
 *      visible. It provides common controls such as 'File' and 'Help' menu options, text and draw
 *      controls, and a 'combined' panel for text editing and drawing.
 *      
 *  STRUCTURE:
 *      This class is divided into several files, which are all responsible for performing a specific
 *      task. The files are simply extensions of this class, i.e. '... partial class...'. Below is a
 *      description of each 'partial class' and its purpose.
 * 
 *      mainForm.cs - (You are here) This file is the starting point of the MainForm class. It
 *                    contains the constructor and is responsible for coordinating interactions
 *                    between other parts of the class and the application.
 *               
 *      formMenuStrip.cs - This file handles events that are triggered by elements
 *                         of the menu strip in the form. (Ex: File, Edit, ... Help)
 *                    
 *      formToolbar.cs - This file is responsible for controls in the toolbar and
 *                       their events in the main form. (Ex: Font, Text, Color, Line...)
 *                  
 *      formTextbox.cs - This file is responsible for appearance and events of the richTextBox and its
 *                       layers. Variables were created and initialized immediately in the declaration
 *                       section for reusability, to avoid repetition of creation in order to increase
 *                       drawing performance. Some variables are initialized in the main constructor.
 *                       Other components have been separated into regions each with appropriate comments.

         *  This method gets called before elements are shown on screen. It is used to update and

         * NAME
         *  fontComboBox_SelectedIndexChanged() - changes the text font
         *  
         * SYNOPSIS
         *  private void fontComboBox_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, System.EventArgs e);
         *      sender  -> does nothing
         *      e       -> does nothing
         * 
         * DESCRIPTION
         *  This method gets called upon selecting a choice of font style from a combo box. This will
         *  only happen before the user types anything in the text box. This is because each font has
         *  specific line spacing assigned to it. Furthermore, text has to stay coordinated with any
         *  drawing on the panel. Modifying text font will change its size and spacing relative to any
         *  drawing. After the user makes initial modification to the text box or the panel, the combo
         *  box will be disabled and this method will no longer be called.
